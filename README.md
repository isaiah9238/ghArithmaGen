# ArithmaGen Engine
created by Gemini with my assistants.
**Professional Mathematics & Engineering Visualizer**

### Project Overview
ArithmaGen is a modular graphing engine designed to bridge the gap between theoretical physics and practical land surveying. This repository hosts the **Arithma-Sketch** micro-app, a "workable" prototype demonstrating real-time coordinate tracking and manual input drivers.

### Core Files
* **index.html** — The Arithma-Sketch terminal interface.
* **styles.css** — **Golden Earth** high-contrast dark theme.
* **script.js** — Core plotting engine and manual input logic.

---

### Current Features
* **Manual Input Mode**: Use arrow keys to simulate "knob" controls for drawing on the grid.
* **Real-time Coordinate Tracking**: Active monitoring of X and Y positions relative to the origin.
* **Offset Monitoring**: Integrated card trackers ready to monitor distances between surveying lines.

### Surveying Standards (Pennsylvania)
The engine is being optimized for **PA Surveying Standards**, supporting:
* **Quadrant Bearings**: Inputting directions like `N 45-30-22 E`.
* **Offset Distances**: Calculating parallel right-of-way lines and property boundaries.

### How to use
1. Open the repository link in your browser.
2. Use **Arrow Keys** to move the pen.
3. Use the **Spacebar** to "Shake" (clear) the canvas.
4. Monitor the sidebar for precision coordinate feedback.
